% Description: works out the distance between two points
% Args: A = point a described as a 2 x 1 array
%       B = point a described as a 2 x 1 array
%
% Returns: dist, which is 

function dist = find_distance(A,B)

Ax = A(1,1);
Ay = A(2,1);

Bx = B(1,1);
By = B(2,1);

dist_sqrd = ( Ax - Bx )^2 + ( Ay - By)^2;

dist = sqrt( dist_sqrd );
